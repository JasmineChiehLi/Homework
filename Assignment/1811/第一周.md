### 理论课  
#### Lecture 6  
- Explain the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling.  

- Suppose that a scheduling algorithm (at the level of short-term CPU scheduling) favors those  processes that have used the least processor time in the recent past. Why will this algorithm favor I/O-bound programs and yet not permanently starve CPU-bound programs?  

- Discuss how the following pairs of scheduling criteria conflict in certain settings.  

  - a. CPU utilization and response time  
  - b. Average turnaround time and maximum waiting time  
  - c. I/O device utilization and CPU utilization  

- Consider the following set of processes, with the length of the CPU-burst time given in milliseconds:  
  
| Process | Burst Time | Priority |  
|:------:|:------:|:------:|  
| P1 | 2 | 2 |  
| P2 | 1 | 1 |  
| P3 | 8 | 4 |  
| P4 | 4 | 2 |  
| P5 | 5 | 3 |  

  The processes are assumed to have arrived in the order P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, all at time 0.  

  - a. Draw four Gantt charts illustrating the execution of these processes using FCFS, SJF, a nonpreemptive priority (a smaller priority number implies  a higher priority), and RR (quantum = 1) scheduling.  
  - b. What is the turnaround time of each process for each of the scheduling algorithms in part a?  
  - c. What is the waiting time of each process for each of the scheduling algorithms in part a?  
  - d. Which of the schedules in part a results in the minimal average waiting time (over all processes)?  
  
#### Lecture 8  
- What is the meaning of the term busy waiting? What other kinds of waiting are there in an operatin system? Can busy waiting be avoided altogether? Expain your answer.
