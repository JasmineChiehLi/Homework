## 操作系统  
### 理论课  
- Assume that a program has just referenced an address in virtual memory. Describe a scenario in which each of the following can occur. (If no such scenario can occur, explain why.)  
	- TLB miss with no page fault  
	- TLB miss and page fault  
	- TLB hit and no page fault  
	- TLB hit and page fault  
- What is the copy-on-write feature, and under what circumstances is its use beneficial? What hardware support is required to implement this feature?  
- Consider the following page reference string:  
	- 7, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 1, 0, 5, 4, 6, 2, 3, 0 , 1.  
	- Assuming demand paging with three frames, how many page faults would occur for the following replacement algorithms?  
		- LRU replacement  
		- FIFO replacement  
		- Optimal replacement  
- What is the cause of thrashing? How does the system detect thrashing? Once it detects thrashing, what can the system do to eliminate this problem?  
- 10.1 10.5 10.7
